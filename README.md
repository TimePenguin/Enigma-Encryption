# Enigma-Encryption
I created an Enigma Encryption Device that encrypts text
This also doubles as a decrypter if you copy past the code into a second file and change file names to decrypt instead of encrypt
The Enigma Encryption Device is modeled off the system potrayed in this link: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/14/how-did-enigma-machine-work-imitation-game
The Enigma Encryption Device is a dynamic encryption where the letter mapping always changed - if you wanted to encrypt "aaaaa", it would become "fdsfq"
This Enigma Encryption Device was used by the Germans in World War II, and it took Alan Turing to crack it
